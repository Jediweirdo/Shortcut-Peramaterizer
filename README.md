# Shortcut Peramaterizer

A Scriptable script that passes data given to a Shortut of choice. Made to take advantage of Scriptable's https:// URL launch scheme for forwarding content to Shortcuts on servies that don't support custom/app URLs

## Features

- Automatially assembles and launches the Shortcut URL upon successful launch
- Automatically parses out Scriptable URL parameters so they don't get passed to your Shortcut
- Really Basic Error Detection
- Supports both text and clipboard Shortcut URL scheme input types
- That's about it

## Usage/Examples
As stated before, this scipt **isn't made to be run manually**. Instead, you should run it with paramaters from a scriptable URL Scheme. The format required base format is as follows:
```javascript
scriptable://run/shortcut-paramaterizer?name=[Shortcut Name]&input=[Input Type]
```
If you want to start the redirect with `https://`, then it goes as follows:
```
https://open.scriptable.app/run/shortcut-peramaterizer?name=[Shortcut Name]&input=[Input Type]
```
To quickly explain each required feild:
- `name=`: The name of the **shortcut** you want this to open
- `input=`: The input type of the Shortcut ("Clipboard" or "Text" is supported)

You can also add the Scriptable-specifc URLs `openEditor` and `ScriptName` without fear of it being added to the shortcut's input dictionary

After that, you can add as many Paramaters as you want to pass into the chosen shortcut. The format is as follows:
```
[Required parts of URL]&[First Paramater's Name]=[First Paramater's Value]&[Second Paramater's Name]=[Second Paramater's Value]...
```
## Installation

You can install this script through [Shareable](). 

Alternatively, you can manually install this by downloading the  [Latest Release](https://github.com/Jediweirdo/Shortcut-Peramaterizer/releases/tag/v1.0.0) and sharing the corresponding `.shortcut` file with Scriptable and selecting "Add Script"

    
## Bulding

To build shortcut-peramaterizer, simply download the javasript code to you Scriptable-installed device and move the file to wherever the Scriptable folder is saved on our device. For me, it's `iCload Drive://Scriptable`

## Acknowledgements

 - Gluebyte and the helpers on the [Shortcuts Discord](https://discord.gg/HrzAhUu) for helping me troubleshoot this
  - [Scriptable Docs]() for showing me the ropes
  - A JS/Scriptable Docs reference sheet generated by ChatGPT because I hate JS
  And You, for checking this out :)
## Roadmap

- Integrating Shareable's Software Update API if I ever decie to update this again
- Add more protections like duplicate Dictionary Key Name Detection
- Overrides that allow you to pass keys that are normally pruned from the dictoionary
- Custom `name` and `input` keys in case you need to use those for something else

Don't hold your breath wating for this, though. I'm probabl never updating this again unless there's a bug or something. Like I said before, I have JS and only touch it when I need to

Contribute if you want, but no promises that I merge it. I exactly don't expect to be active on this repo...
